# Payment method in an e-commerce app
        In this example, the Strategy pattern is used to implement the various payment methods in an e-commerce application. After selecting a product to purchase, a customer picks a payment method: either Paypal or credit card.
    
        Concrete strategies not only perform the actual payment but also alter the behavior of the checkout form, providing appropriate fields to record payment details.
